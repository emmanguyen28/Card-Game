Card Game by Emma Nguyen'20. CS101 @Fall2017

This version of the Card Game is a single-player game. When the user clicks on a card, the symbol is displayed. When the user clicks on a second card, its symbol is also displayed. If the cards have different symbols, they are both turned face down again. If the cards have the same symbol, on the next click both cards are removed from the display. The player's goal is to remove all cards from the display in as few clicks as possible by remembering where they have seen the symbols.

This version is written in Java using the objectdraw library of BlueJ IDE.
